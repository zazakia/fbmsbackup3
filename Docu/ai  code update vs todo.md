ÔøΩÔøΩ KEY FINDINGS
What's Actually Working:
Core Business Logic - All major modules have functional UI
Data Management - CRUD operations for all entities
State Management - Zustand stores properly implemented
Authentication - Complete login/registration system
Basic Reporting - Dashboard with charts and analytics
What's Missing/Incomplete:
Advanced Reporting - Only basic charts, no detailed reports
PDF Generation - BIR forms show UI but no actual PDF export
Multi-branch Logic - UI exists but no actual branch functionality
Export Features - CSV export exists, but no Excel/PDF
Integration Features - No actual API integrations
Accuracy Assessment:
Todo.md is ~70% accurate in marking features as complete
Major overstatements in reporting and BIR compliance
Some features are more complete than marked (multi-branch UI)
Core functionality is accurately represented
üìã RECOMMENDATIONS
Update todo.md to reflect actual implementation status
Prioritize completing the reporting system
Implement actual PDF generation for BIR forms
Add real multi-branch functionality
Complete export features (Excel/PDF)
The project is well-structured and functional but the todo.md overstates completion of advanced features! üéØ
