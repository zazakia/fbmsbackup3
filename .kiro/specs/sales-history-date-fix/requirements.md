## Introduction

The sales history display is currently showing an "Invalid time value" error when attempting to display sales data from the Supabase sales table. This error prevents users from viewing their sales history and analytics, which is critical for business operations. The issue appears to be related to date/time formatting or parsing when retrieving and displaying sales data.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want to view my sales history without encountering date/time errors, so that I can track my business performance and make informed decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the sales history page THEN the system SHALL display sales data without any "Invalid time value" errors
2. WHEN sales data is retrieved from the Supabase sales table THEN the system SHALL properly parse and format all date/time fields
3. WHEN displaying sales transactions THEN the system SHALL show readable date and time information in the local Philippine timezone
4. IF a sales record has invalid or null date values THEN the system SHALL handle it gracefully without breaking the display

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a cashier, I want to see accurate timestamps for all sales transactions, so that I can verify when sales occurred and resolve any customer inquiries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing individual sales transactions THEN the system SHALL display the correct date and time for each sale
2. WHEN sales data contains timestamps THEN the system SHALL format them consistently across all views (dashboard, reports, history)
3. WHEN filtering sales by date range THEN the system SHALL use proper date comparison logic
4. IF timezone conversion is needed THEN the system SHALL convert UTC timestamps to Philippine Standard Time (PST)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a manager, I want sales analytics and charts to display correct date information, so that I can analyze sales trends and patterns accurately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing sales charts and analytics THEN the system SHALL use properly formatted dates for x-axis labels
2. WHEN aggregating sales data by date THEN the system SHALL group transactions correctly by day, week, or month
3. WHEN displaying recent transactions THEN the system SHALL show relative time information (e.g., "2 hours ago", "yesterday")
4. WHEN exporting sales reports THEN the system SHALL include properly formatted date columns

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want robust error handling for date/time operations, so that the application remains stable even with inconsistent data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN encountering invalid date values THEN the system SHALL log the error and display a fallback message
2. WHEN date parsing fails THEN the system SHALL not crash the entire sales history view
3. WHEN database queries return malformed timestamps THEN the system SHALL sanitize and validate the data
4. IF date formatting libraries encounter errors THEN the system SHALL provide graceful fallbacks
