# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Fix core inventory movement type classification bug
  - Update the `STOCK_OUT_TYPES` array in `createMovementRecord` function to include 'sale' as a stock-decreasing operation
  - Modify the movement type logic to properly handle sales transactions as inventory decreases
  - Add comprehensive movement type constants for better maintainability
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.5, 2.1, 2.2_

- [x] 2. Implement stock validation and error handling
  - Add pre-sale stock validation to prevent overselling before transaction completion
  - Implement proper error handling for insufficient stock scenarios
  - Add validation to ensure stock never goes negative during sales processing
  - Create user-friendly error messages for stock-related issues
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 1.4, 3.5_

- [ ] 3. Enhance stock movement record creation and tracking
  - Improve the `createMovementRecord` function to create accurate audit trails for sales
  - Add proper reference linking between sales transactions and stock movements
  - Ensure movement records include all necessary metadata (invoice number, customer info)
  - Implement proper error handling for movement record creation failures
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5_

- [ ] 4. Fix multi-item sale processing and data integrity
  - Update the `createSale` function to handle stock updates correctly for all items
  - Implement atomic operations to ensure data consistency in multi-item sales
  - Add rollback capability for partial failures in stock updates
  - Ensure proper sequencing of stock updates and movement record creation
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 3.1, 3.2, 3.5_

- [ ] 5. Create comprehensive tests for inventory management fixes
  - Write unit tests for the fixed `createMovementRecord` function with all movement types
  - Add integration tests for complete sale-to-inventory workflows
  - Create tests for edge cases (zero stock, exact stock matches, insufficient stock)
  - Implement tests for concurrent sale processing and race condition handling
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2.2, 3.3_

- [ ] 6. Add inventory reconciliation and monitoring capabilities
  - Create utility functions to verify stock level accuracy after operations
  - Add logging and monitoring for stock movement operations
  - Implement stock reconciliation tools to identify and fix discrepancies
  - Add debugging capabilities for troubleshooting inventory issues
  - _Requirements: 2.5, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_
