# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses a critical bug in the Point of Sale (POS) system where inventory quantities are incorrectly increased instead of decreased when sales transactions are completed. This bug affects the core business logic of inventory management and can lead to inaccurate stock levels, overselling, and financial discrepancies.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a cashier, I want the inventory quantities to be correctly decreased when I complete a sale transaction, so that the system maintains accurate stock levels and prevents overselling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a sale transaction is completed THEN the system SHALL decrease the inventory quantity for each sold item by the exact quantity sold
2. WHEN multiple items are sold in a single transaction THEN the system SHALL decrease the inventory for each item individually based on their respective quantities
3. WHEN a sale is completed THEN the resulting inventory quantity SHALL never be negative (system should prevent overselling)
4. IF insufficient stock is available THEN the system SHALL prevent the sale completion and display an appropriate error message
5. WHEN a sale transaction is processed THEN the system SHALL create accurate stock movement records showing the decrease in inventory

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a store manager, I want the stock movement records to accurately reflect sales transactions, so that I can track inventory changes and maintain proper audit trails.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a sale is completed THEN the system SHALL create a stock movement record with type 'sale' or 'stock_out'
2. WHEN stock movement records are created for sales THEN they SHALL show negative quantity changes (decreases)
3. WHEN viewing stock movement history THEN sales transactions SHALL be clearly identifiable and show the correct direction of stock change
4. WHEN a sale is completed THEN the movement record SHALL include reference to the sale invoice number and customer information
5. WHEN stock movements are recorded THEN the resulting stock quantity SHALL match the actual product stock in the system

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want the POS system to maintain data integrity between sales and inventory, so that my financial reports and stock levels are accurate and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sales are processed THEN the total inventory value SHALL be correctly reduced by the cost of goods sold
2. WHEN viewing product stock levels THEN they SHALL reflect all completed sales transactions accurately
3. WHEN generating inventory reports THEN the stock quantities SHALL match the actual available inventory
4. WHEN a sale is voided or returned THEN the inventory quantities SHALL be correctly restored
5. WHEN multiple users process sales simultaneously THEN the inventory updates SHALL be handled correctly without race conditions
