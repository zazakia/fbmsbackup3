# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification covers the integration of real purchases data from Supabase tables into the main FBMS dashboard, specifically focusing on the purchases module dashboard components. The current dashboard displays static/mock data for purchases-related metrics, but the system already has a comprehensive purchases API with suppliers, purchase orders, and receiving functionality. This feature will connect the main dashboard to display live, accurate purchases data from the purchases module to provide business owners with real-time insights into their purchasing operations.
