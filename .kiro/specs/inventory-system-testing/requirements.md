# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification covers comprehensive testing of the Filipino Business Management System (FBMS) inventory management system to ensure all inventory-related features, data flows, and module integrations are fully functional and working correctly. The testing will validate core inventory operations, multi-location tracking, stock movements, integration with POS and accounting systems, and Philippine business compliance requirements.
