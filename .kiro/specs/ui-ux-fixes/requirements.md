4. IF the backup fails THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message with actionable next steps
5. WHEN the backup button is clicked THEN the system SHALL prevent multiple simultaneous backup operations

### Requirement 2

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN UI elements are rendered THEN they SHALL meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards for color contrast
2. WHEN buttons and interactive elements are displayed THEN they SHALL have proper hover, focus, and active states
3. WHEN the system is used on mobile devices THEN all UI elements SHALL be appropriately sized and positioned
