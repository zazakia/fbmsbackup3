## Introduction

This feature involves removing the Help & Documentation module from the main body of the application while preserving its accessibility through the sidebar navigation. The goal is to streamline the main application interface by removing the help module from the primary content area, but users should still be able to access help documentation through the sidebar menu.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the Help & Documentation module removed from the main body content area, so that the main interface is more streamlined and focused on core business functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates through the main application THEN the Help & Documentation module SHALL NOT appear as a selectable option in the main content area
2. WHEN the application renders the main body content THEN the help module case SHALL be removed from the main rendering logic
3. WHEN users access the application THEN the main interface SHALL display only core business modules (dashboard, POS, inventory, etc.)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to continue accessing Help & Documentation through the sidebar menu, so that I can still get support and guidance when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user looks at the sidebar navigation THEN the Help & Documentation option SHALL remain visible and accessible
2. WHEN a user clicks on Help & Documentation in the sidebar THEN the help menu dropdown SHALL display properly
3. WHEN a user interacts with the help menu THEN all existing help functionality SHALL work as before
4. WHEN the help module is accessed through the sidebar THEN it SHALL open in an appropriate manner (modal, overlay, or separate view)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the help module code to remain intact and functional, so that the help system can be easily restored or accessed through alternative means in the future.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the help module is removed from main body THEN all help component files SHALL remain unchanged
2. WHEN the help module is removed from main body THEN the LazyHelpModule import SHALL be removed from the main App component
3. WHEN the help module is removed from main body THEN the help navigation item SHALL be filtered out from the main navigation items
4. WHEN the help module is removed from main body THEN no help-related functionality SHALL be broken in the sidebar
