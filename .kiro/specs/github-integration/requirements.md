# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will integrate GitHub functionality into the Filipino Business Management System (FBMS) to enable version control, code backup, and collaborative development capabilities. The integration will provide seamless GitHub operations directly from the FBMS interface, allowing developers and administrators to manage code repositories, track changes, and maintain project history.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to connect the FBMS to a GitHub repository, so that I can automatically backup code changes and maintain version history.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the administrator accesses GitHub settings THEN the system SHALL display GitHub configuration options
2. WHEN the administrator provides GitHub credentials THEN the system SHALL validate and store the connection securely
3. WHEN the connection is established THEN the system SHALL display repository status and basic information
4. IF the connection fails THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages and troubleshooting guidance

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to commit and push changes to GitHub directly from the FBMS interface, so that I can maintain version control without leaving the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the developer makes changes to the system THEN the system SHALL detect modified files automatically
2. WHEN the developer initiates a commit THEN the system SHALL provide a commit message interface with validation
3. WHEN the commit is created THEN the system SHALL push changes to the configured GitHub repository
4. WHEN the operation completes THEN the system SHALL display success confirmation and commit details
5. IF the push fails THEN the system SHALL display error details and retry options

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want to view GitHub repository status and recent commits, so that I can monitor development progress and code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the manager accesses the GitHub dashboard THEN the system SHALL display current repository status
2. WHEN viewing commit history THEN the system SHALL show recent commits with timestamps, authors, and messages
3. WHEN viewing repository details THEN the system SHALL display branch information, file changes, and statistics
4. WHEN checking sync status THEN the system SHALL indicate if local changes need to be pushed or pulled

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure automated GitHub backups, so that critical system changes are automatically preserved in version control.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring backup settings THEN the system SHALL provide scheduling options (daily, weekly, on-change)
2. WHEN automated backup triggers THEN the system SHALL create commits with descriptive messages
3. WHEN backup completes THEN the system SHALL log the operation and notify administrators
4. IF backup fails THEN the system SHALL retry automatically and alert administrators of persistent failures
5. WHEN viewing backup history THEN the system SHALL display successful and failed backup attempts

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to manage GitHub branches and pull requests, so that I can follow proper development workflows and collaborate effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a new branch THEN the system SHALL validate branch names and create the branch on GitHub
2. WHEN switching branches THEN the system SHALL update the local environment to match the selected branch
3. WHEN viewing pull requests THEN the system SHALL display open PRs with status and review information
4. WHEN merging changes THEN the system SHALL provide merge options and conflict resolution guidance
5. IF conflicts exist THEN the system SHALL highlight conflicts and provide resolution tools

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to secure GitHub integration with proper authentication and permissions, so that repository access is controlled and audited.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up GitHub integration THEN the system SHALL use secure authentication methods (OAuth, personal access tokens)
2. WHEN storing credentials THEN the system SHALL encrypt sensitive information
3. WHEN accessing GitHub features THEN the system SHALL validate user permissions for each operation
4. WHEN operations are performed THEN the system SHALL log all GitHub activities for audit purposes
5. IF authentication expires THEN the system SHALL prompt for re-authentication without exposing credentials
