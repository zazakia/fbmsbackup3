# Netlify Deployment Fix - pnpm-lock.yaml Dependency Mismatch

## Problem
The Netlify deployment was failing due to a mismatch between the `pnpm-lock.yaml` file and the `package.json` file. Specifically, the `supabase@^2.30.4` dependency was added to `package.json` but the `pnpm-lock.yaml` file was not updated to reflect this change.

## Error Message
```
ERR_PNPM_OUTDATED_LOCKFILE  Cannot install with "frozen-lockfile" because pnpm-lock.yaml is not up to date with <ROOT>/package.json

Failure reason:
specifiers in the lockfile don't match specifiers in package.json:
* 1 dependencies were added: supabase@^2.30.4
```

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated pnpm-lock.yaml
```bash
pnpm install
```
This command updated the `pnpm-lock.yaml` file to match the current `package.json` specifications.

### 2. Enhanced Netlify Configuration
Updated `netlify.toml` to properly handle pnpm:
```toml
[build]
  command = "pnpm run build"
  publish = "dist"
  functions = "netlify/functions"

[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "18"
  NPM_FLAGS = "--version"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200

[dev]
  command = "pnpm run dev"
  port = 5180
  publish = "dist"
```

### 3. Added Node.js Version Specification
Created `.nvmrc` file:
```
18
```

### 4. Committed and Deployed
```bash
npm run push:deploy "Update Netlify config for pnpm compatibility"
```

## Prevention for Future

### 1. Always Update Lock Files
When adding new dependencies, always run:
```bash
pnpm install
```

### 2. Use the Enhanced Scripts
The updated scripts now include deployment functionality:
```bash
# Push and deploy in one command
npm run push:deploy "Your commit message"

# Full workflow with deployment
npm run git:deploy "Your commit message"
```

### 3. Check Before Committing
Before committing, ensure lock files are up to date:
```bash
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
```

### 4. CI/CD Best Practices
- Always commit both `package.json` and `pnpm-lock.yaml` together
- Use `--frozen-lockfile` in CI environments
- Specify exact Node.js version in `.nvmrc`
