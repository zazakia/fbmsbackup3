# ðŸ”§ Supabase Studio Workaround

## Issue
Supabase Studio is trying to connect to `supabase_db_fbmsbackup3Local` which has DNS resolution issues, but our data is in the working `supabase_db_fbmsbackup3` database.

## âœ… Working Solutions:

### Option 1: Direct Database Access (Recommended)
```bash
# Connect directly to the working database
docker exec -it supabase_db_fbmsbackup3 psql -U postgres -d postgres

# Then run SQL commands directly:
# \dt          - List all tables
# \d products  - Describe products table
# SELECT * FROM products LIMIT 5;
```

### Option 2: Use the App Interface (Best for Testing)
Instead of Studio, use your actual application at http://localhost:5181:
- âœ… **Inventory section** - View and manage products
- âœ… **Add/Edit products** - Test full functionality  
- âœ… **Categories** - Manage product categories
- âœ… **Sales** - Process transactions

### Option 3: Alternative Database Tools
- **pgAdmin** - Web-based PostgreSQL administration
- **DBeaver** - Universal database tool
- **Connect via:** `localhost:54332` (the working database port)

## ðŸ§ª Test Your App Now!

**Primary Goal:** Verify the app works with the database we just set up.

**Visit:** http://localhost:5181

**Test Checklist:**
- [ ] App loads without hanging
- [ ] Products display in inventory (should see 4 items)
- [ ] Categories work in dropdowns  
- [ ] Can add new products
- [ ] No timeout errors in console

## ðŸ“Š Direct Data Verification
```bash
# Quick verification that your data is there:
docker exec supabase_db_fbmsbackup3 psql -U postgres -d postgres -c "
SELECT 
    name, 
    category, 
    price, 
    stock 
FROM products 
WHERE is_active = true;"
```

**Expected Output:** 4 products with categories and prices

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps
1. **Test the app first** - This is the real test of success
2. **Studio issues are secondary** - We can fix them later if needed
3. **Focus on functionality** - The database is working perfectly

The database setup is complete and functional - Studio connectivity is a separate issue that doesn't affect your application!
