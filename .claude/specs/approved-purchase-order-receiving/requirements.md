# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses a critical workflow gap in the purchase order management system where approved purchase orders do not automatically appear in the receiving list for goods receipt processing. Currently, when purchase orders are approved, they remain disconnected from the receiving workflow, creating operational inefficiencies and potential inventory discrepancies. This enhancement will establish the proper integration between the purchase order approval process and the receiving dashboard, ensuring seamless workflow continuity for Philippine SME operations.
