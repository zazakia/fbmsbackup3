# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical issues with purchase order stock deductions and establishes an improved workflow for purchase order management and goods receiving. The current system has problems with inventory adjustments when purchase orders transition to "received" status, leading to inaccurate stock levels and potential financial discrepancies. This feature will implement a robust purchase order lifecycle management system with proper inventory tracking, clear workflows, and accurate cost accounting.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a warehouse manager, I want purchase orders to properly adjust inventory levels when goods are received, so that stock quantities remain accurate and I can trust the inventory data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a purchase order is marked as "received" THEN the system SHALL increase inventory quantities by the received amounts for each product
2. WHEN a purchase order is partially received THEN the system SHALL update inventory quantities only for the actual received items
3. WHEN inventory adjustments are made THEN the system SHALL create an audit trail entry with timestamp, user, and reason
4. IF a purchase order contains multiple products THEN the system SHALL process each product's inventory adjustment independently
5. WHEN stock levels are updated THEN the system SHALL recalculate average cost for each affected product

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a procurement officer, I want a clear purchase order workflow with defined states and transitions, so that I can track order progress and ensure proper approvals.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a purchase order is created THEN the system SHALL set the initial status to "Draft"
2. WHEN a draft purchase order is submitted THEN the system SHALL change status to "Pending Approval" 
3. WHEN an authorized user approves a purchase order THEN the system SHALL change status to "Approved"
4. WHEN goods start arriving THEN the system SHALL allow transition to "Partially Received" status
5. WHEN all items are received THEN the system SHALL allow transition to "Fully Received" status
6. WHEN a purchase order needs cancellation THEN the system SHALL allow transition to "Cancelled" status from Draft or Approved states only
7. IF a user attempts an invalid status transition THEN the system SHALL prevent the change and display an error message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a warehouse staff member, I want to record partial receipts against purchase orders, so that I can update inventory as goods arrive in multiple shipments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN recording a partial receipt THEN the system SHALL allow entering quantities less than or equal to the outstanding amount for each item
2. WHEN a partial receipt is recorded THEN the system SHALL update the "received quantity" field for each item
3. WHEN partial receipts are recorded THEN the system SHALL calculate and display remaining quantities to be received
4. WHEN all items have been partially or fully received THEN the system SHALL automatically change the purchase order status to "Fully Received"
5. IF received quantity exceeds ordered quantity THEN the system SHALL warn the user and require confirmation before proceeding
6. WHEN partial receipts are saved THEN the system SHALL create individual stock movement entries for each received item

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an inventory manager, I want to see detailed receiving history and stock movements for purchase orders, so that I can audit inventory changes and resolve discrepancies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing a purchase order THEN the system SHALL display a complete receiving history with dates, quantities, and receiving staff
2. WHEN stock movements occur due to receiving THEN the system SHALL record the movement type as "Purchase Order Receipt"
3. WHEN displaying stock movements THEN the system SHALL show the related purchase order number and supplier information
4. WHEN a user views inventory transactions THEN the system SHALL show before and after quantities for each stock adjustment
5. IF stock movements are related to purchase orders THEN the system SHALL provide a direct link to the originating purchase order
6. WHEN generating inventory reports THEN the system SHALL include purchase order receipts as a distinct transaction category

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an accounting staff member, I want purchase order receipts to properly update product costs and financial accounts, so that cost of goods sold and inventory values remain accurate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN goods are received THEN the system SHALL update the weighted average cost for each product based on the purchase price
2. WHEN inventory costs are updated THEN the system SHALL adjust the total inventory value in the general ledger
3. WHEN a purchase order is fully received THEN the system SHALL create accounts payable entries for the total amount
4. IF there are price differences between ordered and received amounts THEN the system SHALL create price variance entries
5. WHEN partial receipts occur THEN the system SHALL calculate and record proportional costs for the received quantities
6. WHEN cost adjustments are made THEN the system SHALL maintain audit trails showing old and new cost values

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want role-based access controls for purchase order operations, so that only authorized personnel can approve orders and record receipts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user attempts to approve a purchase order THEN the system SHALL verify the user has "Purchase Order Approval" permission
2. WHEN a user tries to record receipts THEN the system SHALL verify the user has "Goods Receiving" permission

4. IF a user has "View Only" permissions THEN the system SHALL display purchase orders in read-only mode
5. WHEN users with "Purchase Order Creation" permission create orders THEN the system SHALL allow saving as draft but require approval from authorized users
6. WHEN permission changes occur THEN the system SHALL immediately apply the new access restrictions without requiring user logout

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system user, I want the purchase order receiving process to handle errors gracefully and provide clear feedback, so that I can quickly resolve issues and complete transactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database errors occur during receipt recording THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages and suggest corrective actions
2. WHEN network connectivity issues interrupt receipt processing THEN the system SHALL allow offline operation with automatic sync when connection is restored
3. WHEN duplicate receipts are attempted THEN the system SHALL detect and prevent double-processing with appropriate warning messages
4. IF required fields are missing during receipt entry THEN the system SHALL highlight the missing information and prevent submission
5. WHEN data validation fails THEN the system SHALL show specific error messages for each validation failure
6. WHEN system errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for troubleshooting while showing simple messages to users
