# Requirements Document: Sidebar Module Loading Fix

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for fixing critical module loading issues in the sidebar navigation system. The system currently experiences failures when loading specific business modules (expenses, operations, BIR forms, payroll, cloud backup) when users click on them in the sidebar menu. These modules are essential for daily business operations and must load reliably and performantly.

The issue affects a React-based business management system that uses lazy loading with Suspense for performance optimization. The system serves multiple user roles (Admin, Manager, Employee, Accountant) with role-based access control and module-specific permissions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Module Loading Reliability

**User Story:** As a business user, I want all sidebar menu items to load their respective modules consistently, so that I can access all required business functions without interruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on the "Expenses" menu item THEN the system SHALL load the ExpenseTracking component within 3 seconds without errors
2. WHEN a user clicks on the "Operations" menu item THEN the system SHALL load the ManagerOperations component within 3 seconds without errors
3. WHEN a user clicks on the "BIR Forms" menu item THEN the system SHALL load the BIRForms component within 3 seconds without errors
4. WHEN a user clicks on the "Payroll" menu item THEN the system SHALL load the PayrollManagement component within 3 seconds without errors
5. WHEN a user clicks on the "Cloud Backup" menu item THEN the system SHALL load the CloudBackup component within 3 seconds without errors
6. WHEN any module fails to load initially THEN the system SHALL automatically retry loading the module once before displaying an error
7. IF a module loading attempt fails twice consecutively THEN the system SHALL log the error with module name, user role, timestamp, and error details

### Requirement 2: Error Handling and Recovery

**User Story:** As a business user, I want clear feedback when a module fails to load and simple recovery options, so that I can continue working without losing productivity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a module fails to load THEN the system SHALL display a user-friendly error message within the main content area
2. WHEN displaying a module loading error THEN the system SHALL provide a "Retry" button that attempts to reload the specific module
3. WHEN displaying a module loading error THEN the system SHALL provide a "Go to Dashboard" button as an alternative navigation option
4. WHEN a user clicks the "Retry" button THEN the system SHALL attempt to reload the failed module and show loading feedback
5. WHEN a module loading error occurs THEN the system SHALL maintain the sidebar navigation functionality for other modules
6. IF the same module fails to load 3 times in a user session THEN the system SHALL suggest alternative modules or contact support
7. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information including module name, component path, error message, stack trace, user role, and browser information

### Requirement 3: Loading State Management

**User Story:** As a business user, I want clear visual feedback when modules are loading, so that I understand the system is responding to my actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on any sidebar menu item THEN the system SHALL immediately show a loading spinner in the main content area
2. WHEN a module is loading THEN the system SHALL display "Loading module..." message with the specific module name
3. WHEN a module takes longer than 2 seconds to load THEN the system SHALL show a progress indicator or additional loading message
4. WHEN switching between modules THEN the system SHALL clear the previous module content before showing the loading state
5. WHEN a module is loading THEN the clicked sidebar menu item SHALL show an active/selected visual state
6. WHEN module loading is complete THEN the system SHALL remove all loading indicators and display the module content
7. WHILE a module is loading THEN the system SHALL disable multiple rapid clicks on the same menu item

### Requirement 4: Performance Requirements

**User Story:** As a business user, I want modules to load quickly and efficiently, so that I can access business functions without delays that impact my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on a sidebar menu item THEN the visual feedback SHALL appear within 100 milliseconds
2. WHEN loading any of the affected modules THEN the module content SHALL be displayed within 3 seconds under normal network conditions
3. WHEN a module has been loaded previously in the session THEN subsequent loads SHALL complete within 1 second
4. WHEN multiple users are accessing modules simultaneously THEN the loading performance SHALL not degrade beyond 5 seconds
5. WHEN the browser has cached module resources THEN the loading time SHALL not exceed 2 seconds
6. IF network conditions are slow THEN the system SHALL show a "slow connection detected" message after 5 seconds
7. WHEN loading modules THEN the system SHALL use lazy loading to minimize initial bundle size and improve overall application performance

### Requirement 5: Permission-Based Loading

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want modules to load only when users have appropriate permissions, so that security and access control are maintained during the loading fix.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user without expenses permissions clicks "Expenses" THEN the system SHALL display an access denied message instead of attempting to load the module
2. WHEN a non-manager user clicks "Operations" THEN the system SHALL display an access denied message with clear role requirements
3. WHEN a non-admin user clicks "Cloud Backup" THEN the system SHALL display an access denied message with admin role requirement
4. WHEN checking permissions before loading THEN the system SHALL validate both module permissions and required roles
5. WHEN permission validation fails THEN the system SHALL log the access attempt with user ID, requested module, and user role
6. IF a user's permissions change during their session THEN the system SHALL re-evaluate module access on the next click
7. WHEN displaying access denied messages THEN the system SHALL suggest contacting an administrator to request access

### Requirement 6: Cross-Platform Compatibility

**User Story:** As a business user accessing the system from different devices, I want sidebar module loading to work consistently across desktop and mobile interfaces, so that I can work effectively from any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the desktop sidebar THEN all module loading functionality SHALL work identically to mobile sidebar navigation
2. WHEN accessing modules from mobile bottom navigation THEN the loading behavior SHALL match desktop sidebar behavior
3. WHEN switching between desktop and mobile views THEN the active module state SHALL be preserved
4. WHEN using touch interfaces THEN menu item clicks SHALL register properly without requiring multiple taps
5. WHEN on mobile devices THEN the sidebar SHALL close after successful module loading
6. IF module loading fails on mobile THEN the error handling SHALL provide touch-friendly recovery options
7. WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN users SHALL be able to navigate and select modules using arrow keys and Enter

### Requirement 7: Diagnostics and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive logging and monitoring of module loading issues, so that I can identify patterns and prevent future problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a module loading attempt begins THEN the system SHALL log the attempt with timestamp, module name, and user information
2. WHEN a module loads successfully THEN the system SHALL log the completion time and any performance metrics
3. WHEN module loading fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information including component path, error type, and failure reason
4. WHEN multiple loading failures occur THEN the system SHALL track failure patterns and provide summary reports
5. WHEN in development mode THEN the system SHALL provide detailed console logging for troubleshooting
6. IF loading performance degrades THEN the system SHALL alert administrators when average loading times exceed thresholds
7. WHEN generating error reports THEN the system SHALL include browser information, network conditions, and user session context

### Requirement 8: Fallback and Graceful Degradation

**User Story:** As a business user, I want the system to provide alternative options when modules cannot load, so that I can continue working even when specific modules are unavailable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a critical business module fails to load THEN the system SHALL suggest related modules that provide similar functionality
2. WHEN the ExpenseTracking module fails THEN the system SHALL suggest accessing expenses through the Accounting module
3. WHEN the BIRForms module fails THEN the system SHALL suggest accessing tax functions through the Accounting module
4. WHEN multiple modules fail consecutively THEN the system SHALL provide a "System Status" indicator showing which modules are available
5. WHEN all module loading fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to displaying the Dashboard with basic functionality
6. IF the lazy loading system fails entirely THEN the system SHALL attempt to load modules synchronously as a fallback
7. WHEN fallback options are activated THEN the system SHALL notify users about the degraded functionality and estimated resolution time
