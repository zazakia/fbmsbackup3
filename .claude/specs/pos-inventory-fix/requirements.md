# Requirements Document - POS Inventory Bug Fix

## Introduction

This requirements document addresses a critical bug in the Point of Sale (POS) system where inventory quantities are incorrectly increased instead of decreased when sales transactions are completed. This bug affects the core business logic of inventory management and can lead to inaccurate stock levels, overselling, and financial discrepancies. The fix must ensure that inventory is properly decremented during sales transactions while maintaining data integrity and system reliability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Correct Inventory Deduction Logic

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want inventory quantities to be correctly decreased when sales are completed through the POS system, so that my stock levels accurately reflect actual inventory on hand.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a sale transaction is completed in the POS system THEN the system SHALL decrease the inventory quantity by the exact amount sold for each product
2. WHEN multiple items of the same product are sold in a single transaction THEN the system SHALL decrease the inventory quantity by the total quantity of that product sold
3. WHEN a product's available quantity is insufficient for a sale THEN the system SHALL prevent the transaction and display an appropriate error message
4. WHEN a sale includes products with variants (size, color, etc.) THEN the system SHALL decrease the inventory for the specific variant sold
5. IF a sale transaction is voided or cancelled THEN the system SHALL restore the inventory quantities to their previous state

### Requirement 2: Data Integrity and Validation

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the POS system to maintain data integrity during inventory updates, so that no inventory data is lost or corrupted during the bug fix implementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN inventory quantities are updated THEN the system SHALL validate that the new quantity is a non-negative number
2. WHEN concurrent sales transactions occur THEN the system SHALL handle inventory updates atomically to prevent race conditions
3. WHEN the inventory update fails due to system errors THEN the system SHALL rollback the entire transaction and maintain the original inventory state
4. WHEN inventory reaches zero or below the minimum stock level THEN the system SHALL trigger appropriate alerts or notifications
5. IF database constraints prevent inventory updates THEN the system SHALL log the error and prevent the sale from completing

### Requirement 3: Transaction History and Audit Trail

**User Story:** As an inventory manager, I want to track all inventory changes made through POS transactions, so that I can audit and verify the accuracy of inventory movements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN inventory is decreased due to a POS sale THEN the system SHALL create an audit record with timestamp, transaction ID, product details, and quantity changed
2. WHEN viewing inventory movement history THEN the system SHALL display POS sales as negative movements with clear transaction references
3. WHEN a sale is voided or refunded THEN the system SHALL create separate audit entries for both the original decrease and the restoration increase
4. WHEN generating inventory reports THEN the system SHALL include POS transaction impacts in stock movement calculations
5. IF audit trail creation fails THEN the system SHALL prevent the inventory update and alert administrators

### Requirement 4: Error Handling and Recovery

**User Story:** As a cashier, I want clear error messages and recovery options when inventory-related issues occur during POS transactions, so that I can complete sales efficiently or take appropriate action.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN insufficient inventory prevents a sale THEN the system SHALL display the available quantity and suggest alternatives
2. WHEN inventory update fails during checkout THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and prevent payment processing
3. WHEN system errors occur during inventory updates THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging
4. WHEN inventory discrepancies are detected THEN the system SHALL provide tools for manual adjustment with proper authorization
5. IF the inventory system is temporarily unavailable THEN the system SHALL either queue transactions or operate in offline mode with appropriate warnings

### Requirement 5: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want the inventory bug fix to maintain or improve POS system performance, so that customer checkout times are not negatively impacted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing inventory updates during POS transactions THEN the system SHALL complete the update within 2 seconds under normal load
2. WHEN handling multiple concurrent transactions THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent performance without degradation
3. WHEN the fix is deployed THEN the system SHALL not require extended downtime or service interruption
4. WHEN processing bulk inventory updates THEN the system SHALL use efficient database operations to minimize resource usage
5. IF performance degrades after the fix THEN the system SHALL provide monitoring and alerting capabilities to identify bottlenecks

### Requirement 6: Backward Compatibility and Migration

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the bug fix to work seamlessly with existing data and configurations, so that business operations are not disrupted during the transition.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the fix is deployed THEN existing product and inventory data SHALL remain intact and accessible
2. WHEN processing historical transactions THEN the system SHALL continue to support existing transaction formats and data structures
3. WHEN integrating with external systems THEN existing API contracts and data formats SHALL remain unchanged
4. WHEN users access the POS system after the fix THEN all existing functionality SHALL work without requiring retraining
5. IF data migration is required THEN the system SHALL provide rollback capabilities in case of issues

### Requirement 7: Testing and Validation

**User Story:** As a quality assurance tester, I want comprehensive test scenarios for the inventory bug fix, so that I can verify the correction works properly across all use cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing single-item sales THEN the system SHALL correctly decrease inventory by the quantity sold
2. WHEN testing multi-item sales with the same product THEN the system SHALL aggregate quantities and decrease inventory by the total amount
3. WHEN testing edge cases (zero inventory, minimum stock levels) THEN the system SHALL handle these scenarios appropriately
4. WHEN testing error scenarios (network failures, database issues) THEN the system SHALL maintain data consistency
5. WHEN performing load testing THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent transactions without inventory corruption

### Requirement 8: Security and Access Control

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want inventory updates through POS transactions to maintain proper security controls, so that unauthorized changes cannot be made to inventory data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN POS users process sales THEN the system SHALL verify they have appropriate permissions to modify inventory
2. WHEN inventory updates are made THEN the system SHALL log the user responsible for the transaction
3. WHEN sensitive inventory operations occur THEN the system SHALL require additional authentication if configured
4. WHEN accessing inventory adjustment functions THEN the system SHALL enforce role-based access controls
5. IF unauthorized access is attempted THEN the system SHALL log the attempt and deny access to inventory modification functions
