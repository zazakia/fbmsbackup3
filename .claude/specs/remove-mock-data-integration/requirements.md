# Requirements Document: Remove Mock Data and Ensure Live Supabase Database Integration

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for removing all mock data implementations from the FBMS (Filipino Business Management System) and ensuring that the application exclusively uses live Supabase database integration. Currently, the system operates in three modes: Local Supabase, Cloud Supabase, and Mock Data mode. The goal is to eliminate the mock data fallback mode while maintaining system stability and providing appropriate error handling when the database is unavailable.

The FBMS system currently has 17 business modules with comprehensive state management via Zustand stores. The system includes mock data implementations in API services, test factories, and various fallback mechanisms that need to be identified, analyzed, and removed while preserving data integrity and user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Mock Data Source Identification and Removal

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all mock data sources removed from the production application, so that the system only operates with real database data and provides accurate business information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL NOT initialize any mock data arrays or objects in production code
2. WHEN API services are called THEN they SHALL NOT return mock data under any circumstances
3. WHEN Supabase connection fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages instead of falling back to mock data
4. WHEN examining the codebase THEN all mock data constants, arrays, and objects SHALL be removed from production API files
5. WHERE mock data exists in test files THEN it SHALL remain only for testing purposes and SHALL NOT be accessible to production code
6. WHEN the application loads THEN it SHALL verify Supabase connection and display connection status to users

### Requirement 2: Database Connection Error Handling

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear error messages and guidance when the database is unavailable, so that I understand the system status and know what actions to take.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Supabase connection is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display a user-friendly error message explaining the database connectivity issue
2. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages indicating the type of failure (network, authentication, service unavailable)
3. WHEN users attempt to access data during database downtime THEN the system SHALL offer retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
4. WHEN connection is restored THEN the system SHALL automatically re-establish database operations without requiring page refresh
5. WHERE critical business operations are attempted during downtime THEN the system SHALL queue operations for execution when connectivity is restored
6. WHEN database errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for administrators while showing user-friendly messages to end users

### Requirement 3: Component Data Loading States

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see appropriate loading states and empty states in the application, so that I understand when data is being fetched and when no data exists.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components load data from Supabase THEN they SHALL display loading spinners or skeleton screens during data fetch operations
2. WHEN data queries return empty results THEN components SHALL display appropriate "no data found" messages with actionable guidance
3. WHEN data loading fails THEN components SHALL display error states with retry options
4. WHILE data is being synchronized THEN the system SHALL indicate synchronization status to users
5. WHEN offline mode is detected THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate offline status and limited functionality
6. WHERE real-time data updates occur THEN the system SHALL provide visual indicators of data freshness and update timestamps

### Requirement 4: API Service Database-Only Operations

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all API services to exclusively use Supabase database operations, so that data consistency is maintained and there are no discrepancies between mock and real data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API functions are called THEN they SHALL only execute Supabase database queries without fallback to mock data
2. WHEN Supabase authentication fails THEN API services SHALL return authentication error responses instead of mock data
3. WHEN database queries fail THEN API services SHALL return appropriate error responses with specific error codes
4. WHERE API services currently implement mock data fallbacks THEN these fallbacks SHALL be completely removed
5. WHEN API responses are returned THEN they SHALL include proper HTTP status codes and error messages for failed operations
6. WHILE maintaining backward compatibility THEN API service interfaces SHALL remain consistent but remove mock data paths

### Requirement 5: Business Store State Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application state to always reflect real database data, so that business decisions are based on accurate information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN business stores initialize THEN they SHALL only populate state with data from Supabase database
2. WHEN database connection is unavailable THEN stores SHALL maintain empty state with appropriate error flags
3. WHEN data synchronization occurs THEN stores SHALL update state only with successfully persisted database changes
4. WHERE stores currently use mock data initialization THEN this SHALL be replaced with database-driven initialization
5. WHEN store actions fail due to database issues THEN they SHALL set appropriate error states and maintain data consistency
6. WHILE preserving user experience THEN stores SHALL implement optimistic updates with rollback capability for failed operations

### Requirement 6: Authentication-Dependent Data Access

**User Story:** As a system security officer, I want data access to be strictly controlled by Supabase authentication, so that unauthorized users cannot access business data through mock data fallbacks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users are not authenticated THEN the system SHALL NOT provide any business data access including mock data
2. WHEN authentication sessions expire THEN the system SHALL immediately clear all business data from state and require re-authentication
3. WHEN database queries are executed THEN they SHALL use authenticated Supabase client sessions
4. WHERE role-based access control is implemented THEN it SHALL be enforced at the database level without mock data bypasses
5. WHEN authentication status changes THEN the system SHALL clear any cached or stored data appropriately
6. WHILE maintaining security THEN the system SHALL not expose any data through development-only mock data paths in production

### Requirement 7: Data Persistence and Synchronization

**User Story:** As a business user, I want all my data changes to be reliably saved to the database, so that I don't lose important business information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data changes are made THEN they SHALL be immediately persisted to Supabase database
2. WHEN persistence operations fail THEN the system SHALL notify users and provide retry mechanisms
3. WHEN multiple users modify the same data THEN the system SHALL handle conflicts appropriately with last-write-wins or merge strategies
4. WHERE offline changes are made THEN the system SHALL queue them for synchronization when connectivity is restored
5. WHEN synchronization conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL provide user-friendly conflict resolution options
6. WHILE ensuring data integrity THEN all database operations SHALL use transactions where appropriate

### Requirement 8: Development and Testing Environment Separation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear separation between production database operations and test mock data, so that testing doesn't interfere with live data and mock data doesn't leak into production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running in development mode THEN mock data SHALL only be available in test files and test environments
2. WHEN building for production THEN all mock data references SHALL be excluded from the production build
3. WHEN tests are executed THEN they SHALL use isolated test databases or mock services without affecting production data
4. WHERE test data factories exist THEN they SHALL be clearly marked as test-only and inaccessible to production code
5. WHEN environment variables indicate production THEN no mock data initialization SHALL occur
6. WHILE maintaining development workflow THEN local development SHALL use local Supabase instance instead of mock data

### Requirement 9: Error Boundary and Recovery Mechanisms

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to gracefully handle database errors and provide recovery options, so that temporary issues don't completely break my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database errors occur THEN error boundaries SHALL catch them and display recovery options
2. WHEN transient network errors happen THEN the system SHALL implement automatic retry with exponential backoff
3. WHEN critical operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide manual retry buttons and alternative workflows
4. WHERE data corruption is detected THEN the system SHALL prevent further operations and alert administrators
5. WHEN recovery is successful THEN the system SHALL resume normal operation and clear error states
6. WHILE handling errors THEN the system SHALL preserve user input and form data when possible

### Requirement 10: Performance and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to monitor database performance and connection health, so that I can proactively address issues before they affect users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database operations execute THEN the system SHALL log performance metrics and response times
2. WHEN connection issues are detected THEN the system SHALL alert administrators through configured notification channels
3. WHEN query performance degrades THEN the system SHALL implement query optimization and caching strategies
4. WHERE real-time data is required THEN the system SHALL use Supabase real-time subscriptions efficiently
5. WHEN monitoring data shows patterns THEN the system SHALL provide dashboards and analytics for administrators
6. WHILE maintaining performance THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate caching strategies for frequently accessed data
